# Simple UI Test 

## Solution
There should be a list of "complex object".
In each item in the list, it should show the information of itself.

When user clicks one of the list, then the edit widget should be displayed.
There are some proper form inputs to edit properties of the object, such as text input, color picker and so on.
Once edit finished, user can click save or cancel button to edit the object.
